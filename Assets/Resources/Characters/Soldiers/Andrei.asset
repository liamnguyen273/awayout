    Had to fight
    and join the army at a very young age. Therefore, despite his young age, Andrei
    had a very strong fighting spirit. Good combat skills, proficient use of guns.
    I always have an ideal of fighting to protect the good. He lost his father and
    mother when he was only 5 years old'
